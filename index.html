<div class="bioPara" style="margin-left:37px;margin-top:5px">
	For many years the phantom radiant Omen had no memory of his past and how he came to be in his current state. Firstly working alongside Dr. Sabine Callas (one of his only apparent links to who he used to be) at Kingdom Corporation, he would then go on join her in the founding of the VALORANT Protocol. During his time as a secret agent, Omen was driven by his search to discover who he previously was. Without answers he was unable to find peace, his predicament being only a nightmare for him to live in.
	<br>
	<br>
	It was then after over a decade of time that a path towards the truth finally appeared when the Protocol came across an hourglass symbol after one of their missions, something that immediately triggered a sense of recognition in Omen. Soon after, VALORANT then ended up meeting the person responsible for this symbol appearing, the young assassin Li Zhao Yu, who was recruited into the organization as "Iso". At first it was hard to get much information out of Iso as he shut down many queries about his own past, but eventually he came forward with his own truth; he had still been working undercover for his former employer, the Scions of Hourglass, and he had joined VALORANT in order to access his next target: Omen. It was only after seeing the differences between the two organizations that Iso had chosen to truly defect from Hourglass instead as he had initially pretended to, and now he wanted to join in VALORANT's investigation into the SoH to uncover more about them. For Omen specifically however, it was an opportunity to finally get some answers on his past, starting with why this organization, one that Iso said that Omen used to work for too, wanted him dead.
	<br>
	<br>
	Intel eventually led to Protocol to an Hourglass skyscraper base in Jakarta where Iso's former boss was. While VALORANT sent a full strike team to confront and interrogate the boss, Omen was entrusted with carrying this out personally, entering the base alone while the other agents provided support. Going through every guard on his way up to the penthouse, Omen found the boss there and confronted him, but was trapped by the boss within a device that he had set up, using a beam of energy to start ripping him apart. In what was meant to be Omen's final moments, the boss was happy to oblige with Omen's demand for answers, revealing that Omen had been Hourglass' most talented assets in their former mission to keep the substance radianite from being rediscovered, as an assassin known as "Ghost".
	<br>
	<br>
	But the boss' taunting triggered something more in Omen, as more memories of his past began to return. He could suddenly remember the last day before he had changed completely and what he had been doing. As Ghost, he had been sent on a mission to kill Sabine Callas, his old Kingdom colleague and now his fellow Protocol agent "Viper", just as she and Kingdom had been about to rediscover radianite. That last day was the moment of the assassination attempt, but he realized he had failed. Dr. Callas had been able to defended herself, while a vial of chemicals she had been holding had hit Ghost in the face, before he had then ended up becoming trapped within a nearby test chamber. As he had tried to break out, Dr. Callas had then activated it, with the process then turning him from a man into the phantom that he was now. Omen had been left with no memory of this upon his transformation, but Viper had known this whole time. Just as the boss then moved to finish Omen off though in the midst of all of this, the device containing him was destroyed by the strike team, freeing Omen to grab the boss and take him through the window, leaving him to fall to his death.
	<br>
	<br>
	After the events in Jakarta, Omen now has the truth behind how he came to be, but it has only led to more questions and frustration, with Omen finding himself unfocused instead of at peace as he thought he would be once he got his answers. Now needing to find his own path in light of what he has uncovered, Omen has stepped away from the Protocol for now while he recovers. But no matter who he used to be, Omen has since made a new family in VALORANT, and he knows he will return to them in time.
